------Hybrid mobile app development-----------


Hybrid apps are apps that run in a webview in each platform.

 The idea is to code once and export different files to run in each platform (android, ios, windows, blackberry)

 Since you produce code to run in a webview which runs as a browser inside your up you can use HTML to form your content and
 javascript to code the logic that your app will use.

 Due to their structure this kinds of apps can be tested in a simple browser.


All this is made possible buy the use of phone Gap and cordova. You can think of Apache Cordova
as the engine that powers PhoneGap, similar to how WebKit is the engine that powers Chrome or Safari.

Cordova also gives you access to an api that allows to have access to the phones hardware.
