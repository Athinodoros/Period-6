----------Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid Mobile App Development----------
---------------------compared to Native App Development---------------------------



Native apps


--Pros--

1) Native apps have the ability to work with a deviceâ€™s built-in features, often making them
faster and easier to work with on a device. Having an app fully integrated with a device
can be extremely helpful.

2) It is not necessary to have access to the internet to use the app


3) Access system hardware and functionality easier and more effectively

--Cons--

1) Native apps tend to be more expensive to the developer. The costs associated with maintenance
and updates are higher, especially if the app is compatible with more than one type of device.

2) While the app store can be beneficial to a developer, the process involved with approving an
app can be arduous, and success is not guaranteed.

3) Your final product works in only one family of devices.

Hybrid apps

--Pros--

1) Code one app publish in every platform

2) Easier to maintain (especially when you maintain the app for all the devises at once)

3) Use of Javascript and HTML



--Cons--

1) Because developing a hybrid app is very similar to developing a website, many developers
make the mistake of simply copying their web applications to mobile without any kind of redesign.

2)One of the earliest concerns of early hybrid apps was performance. While a number of performance
issues have been fixed over time, there are a number of framework methods and specific architecture fixes
(typically a framework like JQuery Mobile) that can make a hybrid app perform more like a native app.

3) After all it is a web app...
