--------Explain about the "building blocks" involved in an ionic Hybrid Application-------


Ionic is a framework that uses a number of technologies to achieve the end result.

It uses Angular for logic in the presentation layer
It uses Cordova to communicate with the phones Hardware.
It uses HTML5 & Sass for the style and display of the components.
It uses the ADB to communicate with the phone and enable debugging.
And finally node to bring all those together :).
