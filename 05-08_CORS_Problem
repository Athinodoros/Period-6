---------------Explain when and why CORS is a problem for Hybrid Mobile Applications---------------



Since your app runs in a embeded browser calling an api could be tricky because
the W3C standards state that browsers need permission to access the HTTP methods
POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. there for when we design our backend we need
to specify that we allow cross origin resource sharing (CORS).

To do that we could set the following header:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = *

that will enable everyone to access a service.

Or we could provide the app with an API-key so that it can be verified by the server
and gain access to the methods.
